# renders what each mode does (host_test.lua, judged by check.ts), and opens each editor for this
# script to look at and click. GitHub's runners have a display that scripts can capture and click.
# What differs between systems (installing REAPER, the screen, the mouse, dialogs) is in
# `<system>/host-ui.sh`. See docs/plugin.md, "Testing in a host".
